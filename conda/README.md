## Micromamba

`micromamba` is a fully statically-linked, self-contained, executable. This
means that the base environment is completely empty. The configuration for
micromamba is slightly different, namely all environments and cache will be
created by default under the `MAMBA_ROOT_PREFIX` environment variable.
