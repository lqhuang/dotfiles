## Oh-My-Zsh

Alternative git mirror of `ohmyzsh` in China:
<https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/help/ohmyzsh.git>

How to set git url after installing:

```sh
git -C $ZSH remote set-url origin https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/git/ohmyzsh.git
```

Or just install `oh-my-zsh` from mirror git repo.

```sh
REMOTE=https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/git/ohmyzsh.git sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

## Zimfw

- [Commands](https://zimfw.sh/docs/commands/)

Sequence of zmodules is critically important. ü•π

### Completion is not working under Ubuntu

If you use Ubuntu and installed Zsh with apt, then add the following line to your `~/.zshenv` file:

```sh
skip_global_compinit=1
```

In case you're getting a "warning: completion was already initialized before completion module." message in the terminal, then append the following script to `~/.zshenv` and restart your terminal to check further:

```sh
autoload -Uz +X compinit
functions[compinit]=$'print -u2 \'compinit being called at \'${funcfiletrace[1]}
'${functions[compinit]}
```

> I think I cannot get used to autocompletion. I find it a bit annoying. First,

> create the distraction. Next, the logic itself. I have, say, "keyboard.json"
> and "keymaps" directory in my current dir. I type "vim key<TAB>" and it

> order to complete with "keyboard.json" I need to press 3 more keys - DOWN,
